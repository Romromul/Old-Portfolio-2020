This s My Old Portfolio Website Page.

A simple, minimalist web-development portfolio. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
light-box gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.

Background Image\* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use for pretty much whatever.

(\* = Not included)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
